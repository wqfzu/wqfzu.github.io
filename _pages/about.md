<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I work at Colleage of Computer Science and Big Data, Fuzhou University as associate professor now in Fuzhou, Fujian Province.

I am currently engaged in research on Computer Vision, Multimodal Remote Sensing Images, and Speech Enhancement. If you are seeking any form of academic collaboration, please feel free to email me at any time fzuwq@fzu.edu.cn.

I graduated with a Master's degree in Computer Applications from the School of Mathematics and Computer Science at Fuzhou University in 2006. Graduated from the School of Economics and Management, Fuzhou University in 2009 with a PhD in Electronic Government and Regional Resource Management.

My research interests include intelligent interpretation of remote sensing images and computer vision. I have published over 10 papers in well-known national remote sensing journals such as JSTARS and IJRSL with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YK06_mQAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>200+</span></strong></a>.

Two of the graduate students I have supervised have received excellent graduate thesis awards. I can recruit three professional graduate students and one academic graduate student each year. If you are interested in pursuing graduate studies at the School of Computer and Big Data, Fuzhou University, please contact me via email.
